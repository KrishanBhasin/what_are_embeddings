                            <p class="left-align">If you go to the <a href="https://museupicassobcn.cat/en"> Museu Pablo
                                    Picasso in Barcelona</a>, you
                                will see most of the famous artist's early works. They don't look anything like we think
                                of
                                when we think of Picasso. His early works, all painted before he was 16, are carefully
                                constructed
                                displays of his technical genius, only as a classical painter. </p>

                            <p class="left-align">Some particularly prominent examples are <a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_Charity">"Science
                                    and Charity"</a> and <a
                                    href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/first-communion-1896">"First
                                    Communion"</a>,
                                which
                                was
                                completed when the artist was just fifteen. One of my favorites is "Portrait of the
                                Artist's Mother", from 1896, where you can see both the artist's immense talent
                                and his ability to harvest all his energy to draw in the classical style. </p>

                            <p><img src="assets/portrait.png" width="300"></p>

                            <p class="left-align">In order to get to the level of technical abstract mastery that we
                                associate Picasso with
                                today,
                                he had to put in a lot of time mastering fundamental methods and techniques that then
                                allowed
                                him to fully express himself on his terms. </p>

                            <p class="left-align"> The same is the case with machine learning approaches. There's a
                                whole universe
                                of exciting developments at the forefront of large language models, but if we don't
                                understand
                                the historical context and fundamentals of how we get from a word to a BERT
                                representation,
                                we will not be able to fully riff on them, and the machine will control us, other
                                than the other way around.</p>

                            <p class="left-align"> A few years ago, after hearing so much about embeddings, but not a
                                lot about what they
                                actually were,
                                I decided to dive into a long project to understand them, and, in the process,
                                understand the fundamental building
                                blocks of machine learning and natural language processing, particularly as they
                                relate to the context of use in recommendation systems today.</p>

                            <p class="left-align"> Something else Picasso left us with was the quote, "When art critics
                                get together they talk about Form and Structure and Meaning. When artists get together
                                they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine," and it's my hope that this document
                                is not
                                only an introduction to the theory around embeddings, but also places them fully in
                                living, breathing
                                business and engineering context so that engineers, PMs, students, and anyone looking to
                                learn more about
                                fundamentals finds it useful.

                                Machine learning, like all good engineering and like good art, is ultimately, also a
                                beautiful craft made up of patterns, and I hope you find as much joy in exploring them
                                as I did.

                                Good luck!
